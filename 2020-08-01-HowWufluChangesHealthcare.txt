HOW IS THE CURRENT HEALTH CRISIS
CHANGING THE FUTURE OF HEALTHCARE?

More and more Americans are finding
that catching Wuflu is expensive.
Way too many simple minded Americans
want the federal government to help
them. Why do they want the federal
government to help them? Because
they have been taught in America's
public and progressive education
system that the American government
exists to deliver their needs.

Wuflu makes Millennials think that
more government involvement is needed
in health care because capitalsim
didn't solve the problem. Millennials,
being completely ignorant of American
history and economics, address an
issue like Wuflu as a child
would -- "the big daddy must help
me". Their big daddy is the federal
government.

The great American experiment will
almost certainly die under Millennial
(Progressive) leadership and no one
will ever get universal health care
without first becoming impoverished.
Even today one must either have
millions of dollars of assets or
income or impoverish themselves to
get Medicaid -- the only "universal
health care" in America that might
in some cases be free.  No proposed Dem
program changes that fact.

To all progressives that read this
response, I challenge you to engage
on that factual and undeniable
observation about Medicare, Medicate,
the Indian Health Service and the
VA -- programs created by progressives.
Follow progressives and Venezuela
is our future.

PS: Explanation for Wuflu. Wuflu
refers to the virus discovered in
Wuhan, China. It reflects not on
the people of Wuhan or the people
or the people of China. It
reflects and reminds us (or at
least it should) of the evil
of communism, and the Chinese
communist government who
inflicted this virus on the
entire world. Incidentally, it
is also used to "trigger" the
snowflakes, the progressives,
the faux *concerned citizens*
for others' feelings. It is
very entertaining to see all of
them get their panties in a knot
over the use of Wuflu.

PPS: I know this is going to be
taken down from Quora. However
I have archived it in a number
of places. Stay tuned.
